The purpose of this repository is to make a website for my classroom.

All rights for Cookie Clicker go to Orteil

I understand that in the main html of cookie clicker, it says "Feel free to alter this code to your liking, but please do not re-host it, do not profit from it and do not present it as your own." 

Orteil, if you are reading this and you want the Cookie Clicker page taken down, let me know and I will take it down as soon as i can.

I am currently working on copyrighting my website, excluding Cookie Clicker.
